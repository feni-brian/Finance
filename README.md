## Introduction

This is a MERN + Vite web app that showcases an elegant summary of an individuals yearly finances. These are the profits, expenses that include both operational and non operational expenses, and revenues.

It also allows the user to see a calculated prediction of the next annual revenue and/or profits using a machine learning model built in within the app.
